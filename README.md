# SLAM_Arduino_Windows10

A Universal Windows 10 app that maps the surroundings of a robot based on the sensor distance information sent over Serial.
Made for the MECHENG 706 Mechatronics Systems - Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping Robot project.

### It's oddly similar to minesweeper.
Click squares to emulate a sensor reading at that position.
